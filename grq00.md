Each of these questions assumes you are working in the `learncli` container for `comp290`. The first slide of Lecture 1 provides instructions for how to start this container.

## Chapter 1. The Sorcerer's Shell

_1.1. Is there a program named `wget` in the `learncli` container's `/bin` directory?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_1.2. What command did you run to answer the previous question?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_2.1. Is there a program named `wget` in the `learncli` COMP290 container's `/usr/bin` directory?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_2.2. What command did you run to answer the previous question so that you could determine the answer by reading only zero or one line of output_?

Replace this line with your answer.

_3.1. Read the manual for the `whatis` program. What command would you run to use the `whatis` program to display the purpose of `wget`?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_4.1. What is a one-line description of the `bc` program?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_5.1. Run the bc program. What is the result of typing `n=8` on one line followed by `nË†2`? After you get your answer, try a few additional mathematical equations. Finally, type `quit` to end bc._

Replace this line with your answer.

_6.1. Run the `date` program. What timezone, output just before the year, is the container's system clock in?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_6.2. Run the following command: `TZ=America/New_York date` and notice the difference in output from the previous command. (The first part of the command sets something called an _environment variable_ which foreshadows an important concept we'll explore soon.) How many hours apart is this command's output versus 6.1?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_6.3. The timezone definition files for the Americas are located in the directory `/usr/share/zoneinfo/America`. List the files in this directory and find a West Coast city name. Using the `TZ` environment variable from example 6.2, what command would you issue to print the current date and time in `PDT` or Pacific Daylight Time. Test your response._

Replace this line with your answer.

_For each part below there is an example using `grep` with an option. Scroll through the manual for `grep` to determine what each option means and describe in a single English sentence what each command does._

_7.1. `cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep -c ^foo`_

Replace this line with your answer.

_7.2. `cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep --context=2 screaming`_

Replace this line with your answer.

_8.1. Applying your knowledge from 7.1, how many lines in the `/usr/share/dict/words` file contain the string "ee"?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_9.1. What is the purpose of the `head` program?_

Replace this line with your answer.

_9.2. When you run `head` with `/usr/share/dict/words` as an argument, what is the last line printed?_

_10.0. What is the purpose of the `tail` program?_

Replace this line with your answer.
